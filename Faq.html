                 <h3>What is CNG conversion, and how does it work?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
                 <p>CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) conversion is the process of modifying a gasoline or diesel engine so that it can run on natural gas. The conversion involves installing a CNG kit, which includes components like the pressure regulator, injectors, and CNG tank. The engine can then operate on both gasoline/diesel and CNG, switching between the two fuels.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="faq">
                 <h3>Is my vehicle compatible with CNG conversion? <span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
                 <p>Most vehicles with gasoline or diesel engines can be converted to run on CNG. However, it's important to confirm compatibility based on the vehicle's engine type, age, and condition. This will be carried out at our conversion centre before conversion can be carried out.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="faq">
                 <h3>What are the benefits of converting my vehicle to CNG?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
                 <p>CNG conversion offers several benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and a cleaner engine. CNG is also a more environmentally friendly fuel, contributing to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="faq">
                 <h3>How much does CNG conversion cost?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
                 <p>The cost of CNG conversion varies depending on the vehicle type, the CNG kit used, and labor charges. It's important to note that the initial investment can be recovered through savings on fuel costs over time. To confirm the price call: +234 813 346 2928</p>
             </div>
             <div class="faq">
              <h3>How long does it take to convert a vehicle to CNG?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
              <p>Typically, the conversion process takes between 6 to 8 hours, depending on the complexity of the vehicle. In some cases, it may take a full day or more.</p>
          </div>
             <div class="faq">
                 <h3>Will converting to CNG void my vehicle's warranty?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
                 <p> It depends on the manufacturer's policy. Some vehicle manufacturers may void the warranty if a third-party CNG kit is installed. However, many certified conversion kits are designed to work with minimal impact on the vehicle, and using a certified installer may help maintain the warranty.</p>

             <div class="faq">
               <h3>Is CNG safe for my vehicle?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
               <p>Yes, CNG is a safe fuel option. CNG cylinders are built to withstand high pressure, and the fuel system includes several safety mechanisms to prevent leaks or accidents. Additionally, CNG is lighter than air, so it dissipates quickly in case of a leak, reducing fire hazards.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="faq">
               <h3>How often does a CNG system require maintenance?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
               <p>Regular maintenance of a CNG system is essential for optimal performance and safety. Maintenance checks are usually recommended every 10,000 to 20,000 miles, including inspection of the CNG cylinder, valves, and injectors.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="faq">
                  <h3>How far can I drive on a full CNG tank<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
                  <p>The driving range depends on the size of the CNG tank and the vehicle's fuel efficiency. On average, a full CNG tank can provide a range of 100 to 300 miles. Most vehicles have a dual-fuel system, so they can switch to gasoline when CNG is depleted.</p>
             </div>
         <div class="faq">
             <h3>Where can I refill my vehicle with CNG?<span class="dropdown-sign"><img src="./Images/icons8-chevron-right-50.png" alt="dropdown-button"></span></h3>
              <p>CNG refueling stations are available in many regions, particularly in urban areas. There are also mobile apps and websites that provide information on nearby CNG refueling stations. In some countries, home refueling options may be available, allowing vehicle owners to refill their CNG tanks using natural gas from their home supply.</p>
